# GitHubIssues
Extract GitHub issues from GitHub repositories using CURL and the GitHub API v3.

This thing works with paging, each page with 30 objects (default).

The defined repositories are queried for open issues, some attirbutes of which
are echoed on the standard output (CLI).

This output can be cut and paste to a CSV file and copied to Excel...
etc.
etc.
